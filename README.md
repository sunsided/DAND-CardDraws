# Statistics from Card Draws

This folder contains files for _Descriptive Statistics: Computing Statistics from Card Draws_ of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The goal of this project is the exploration of measures of center and variance, as well as the Central Limit Theorem and the usage of z-tables.

This experiment uses a standard deck of playing cards. This is a deck of fifty-two cards divided into four suits (spades (♠), hearts (♥), diamonds (♦), and clubs (♣)), each suit containing thirteen cards (Ace, numbers 2-10, and face cards Jack, Queen, and King).

The file `cards.ipynb` is the main project file.
